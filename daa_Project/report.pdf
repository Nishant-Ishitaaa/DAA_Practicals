Title:

Efficiency in Order: Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

1. Introduction

Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science, used to arrange data in a specific order for easier processing and searching.
This project, Sorting Visualizer, aims to demonstrate the working of various sorting algorithms through a visual representation. It helps users understand how each algorithm sorts an array step by step.

2. Objectives

To visualize and compare different sorting algorithms.

To provide a clear understanding of algorithm behavior through animations.

To build an interactive and educational web-based tool.

3. Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML	Structure of the web page
CSS	Styling and layout
JavaScript	Logic for sorting and animations
VS Code	Code editor used
Live Server	To run and preview the project locally
4. Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort – Compares adjacent elements and swaps if needed.

Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted array one element at a time.

Selection Sort – Finds the minimum element and places it in sorted order.

Merge Sort – Uses divide and conquer technique to split and merge arrays.

Quick Sort – Uses partitioning and recursion for efficient sorting.

5. Working Principle

The program generates an array of random bars representing unsorted numbers.

When the user selects a sorting algorithm and clicks the “Start” button, the corresponding algorithm runs.

Each comparison or swap is visually represented through color changes and movement.

The animation continues until the array becomes fully sorted.

8. Conclusion

The Sorting Visualizer project successfully demonstrates how sorting algorithms work internally. By observing the visualization, users can easily understand differences in algorithm efficiency and behavior.
This project also strengthens fundamental programming and algorithmic understanding while improving front-end development skills.

9. Future Enhancements

Add more algorithms like Heap Sort and Radix Sort.

Include real-time speed and size controls.

Add complexity comparison graphs.
